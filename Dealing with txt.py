Dealing with TXT Files

This script demonstrates how to read from and write to a text file in Python.
It shows how to read all lines at once, read line by line, check if a file is closed,
read the entire file content, and append new content to the file.

    print('Read file all in one:')
    lines = file.readlines()

# Check if file is closed (this checks the last used `file`, which is now out of scope)
print('Is file closed:', file.closed)  # This will always be True when using `with`

# Appending to the file
